## HONNE

### Overview

This is the final project of the Software Engineering bootcamp at GA London. The assignment was to create a full-stack application within one week, and I chose to take on the project solo. It allowed me to balance out my portfolio,having already developed two group projects but only one individually.

Honne is dating app that takes on a new approach and challenges the standard functionality of dating apps allowing users to connect on a deeper level. Users of the application are matched by answering a collection of questions set by other users and as a result, they can identify if their matchesâ€™ values and goals align with their own. All of this is achieved by using the Django REST framework with a PostgreSQL database and a React front-end.

You can launch the game on [Heroku](https://ga-honne.herokuapp.com/), or find the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/seangpachareonsub/honne).
